# Week6 - HTTP introduction

We are going to have some fun with the HTTP protocol. This is the protocol responsible for the entire web to run properly.

Here are the materials:

* [HTTP slides from the Ruby on Rails course](http://rails.hackbulgaria.com/lectures/03#/19)
* [Python's requests module](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
* [What Happens When guide for HTTP](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when)
