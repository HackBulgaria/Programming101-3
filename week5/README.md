# The first teamwork week

We are going to do a bunch of problems, while working in teams of 2.

In order to have a nice flow, check the following materials:

* [GitHub Flow & How to work in teams](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
* [What is a Git branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Branching-What-a-Branch-Is)
* [What is a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
