# Django

We are going to make an introduction to Django.

First, we you need to cover some basic HTML and CSS (without the JavaScript):

* Codecademy has a great track for HTML - http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web


For start, we recommend you to do that official Django tutorial:

* https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/ - from part1 to part6. This will get you started!
* Here is our sample Django project - https://github.com/HackBulgaria/DjangoSample
* The book we recommend about Django is this one - http://twoscoopspress.org/collections/everything/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8
