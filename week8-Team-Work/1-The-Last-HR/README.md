# The Last HR

 The year is 2020 and the HR industry is in peril!
 
Hack Bulgaria's univeristy is strong - teaching students Computer Science of a world class level!

 All the talents are there, and companies see no use for the headhunting and recruting agencies.

 You are one of the last HRs, and you have found a gaping whole in HackBulgaria's system. Blinded by their greatness, they forgot to close their API, listing all students - https://hackbulgaria.com/api/students/

 If you have that information, you may be able to hunt them over facebook or linkedin. Glorious days!

**But you know that Ivo is going to close that API after 1 day. You have to backup the information - there is no other way!**

The tools you have are Python, `requests` and `sqlite3`.

**Your task is to download the entire JSON and keep the data for each student, which courses he is / has been attending! Think of the relations between students and courses and build your tables well. The HR industry is counting on you. Their last hope!**

Good luck!


## Interface for queries

After you have the data, make a simple interface for querying that data:

1. List all students with their GitHub accounts.
2. List all courses,
3. List all students and for each student - list the courses he has been attending.
4. Find the students that have attented the most courses in Hack Bulgaria.
